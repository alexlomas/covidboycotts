# covidboycotts
A list of URLs you can import into something like Pi-Hole to blacklist companies that behaved like asses during the COVID19 outbreak

I think we can all agree that the majority of companies are amazing, but some, you might not want to do business with in the future when the craziness dies down.

This isn't to say any companies on this list are evil or bad, and no inference as to their ethics should be implied.

Pull requests welcome.
